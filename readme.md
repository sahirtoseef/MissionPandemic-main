## Mission Pandemic

Live a healthy life by keeping your distance from the potentially pandemic-infected public while completing daily missions and objectives.

## Installing NodeJS and Grunt

You can get a copy of NodeJS on its site <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org/">here</a> and install it. After installing it you will want to install grunt from the command line.

Now you can install Grunt's command line tools by typing out the following:

<pre lang="javascript">> npm install -g grunt-cli</pre>

From here, Grunt should work via the command line. 

## Setting up the project's Dependencies

Via the command line, navigate into the template directory's root and run the following command:

<pre lang="javascript">> npm install</pre>

This will download all the dependencies in the package.json file and install them locally for you to use. 

## Running the Game

To prepare and run the game, run the following command which will open a local server and launch the game in your browser:

<pre lang="javascript">>grunt</pre>
